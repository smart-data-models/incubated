Light should be assumed to be  measured along the sensor's x-axis (the area of detection is the y-z plane).  The illuminance should have a 0 or positive value and be received with  the sensor's +X axis pointing toward the light source.  Photometric illuminance is the measure of the human eye's sensitivity of the  intensity of light encountering or passing through a surface.  All other Photometric and Radiometric measurements should  not use this message.
