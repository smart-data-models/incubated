Channel names in existing practice include:  \"u\", \"v\" - row and column (respectively) in the left stereo image.  This is opposite to usual conventions but remains for  historical reasons. The newer PointCloud2 message has no  such problem.  \"rgb\" - For point clouds produced by color stereo cameras. uint8  (R,G,B) values packed into the least significant 24 bits,  in order.  \"intensity\" - laser or pixel intensity.  \"distance\"  The channel name should give semantics of the channel (e.g.  \"intensity\" instead of \"value\").
