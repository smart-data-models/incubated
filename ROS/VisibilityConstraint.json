{"target_radius": {"type": "number", "description": "Property.  The constraint is useful to maintain visibility to a disc (the target) in a particular frame.  This disc forms the base of a visibiliy cone whose tip is at the origin of the sensor.  Maintaining visibility is done by ensuring the robot does not obstruct the visibility cone.  Note:  This constraint does NOT enforce minimum or maximum distances between the sensor  and the target, nor does it enforce the target to be in the field of view of  the sensor. A PositionConstraint can (and probably should) be used for such purposes.

The pose in which visibility is to be maintained.  The frame id should represent the robot link to which the sensor is attached.

"}, "max_view_angle": {"type": "number", "description": "Property.  Even though the disc is maintained visible, the visibility cone can be very small  because of the orientation of the disc with respect to the sensor. It is possible  for example to view the disk almost from a side, in which case the visibility cone  can end up having close to 0 volume. The view angle is defined to be the angle between  the normal to the visibility disc and the direction vector from the sensor origin.  The value below represents the minimum desired view angle. For a perfect view,  this value will be 0 (the two vectors are exact opposites). For a completely obstructed view  this value will be Pi/2 (the vectors are perpendicular). This value defined below  is the maximum view angle to be maintained. This should be a value in the open interval  (0, Pi/2). If 0 is set, the view angle is NOT enforced.
