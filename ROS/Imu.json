{"header": {"type": "Header", "description": "Property.  This is a message to hold data from an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)   Accelerations should be in m/s^2 (not in g's), and rotational velocity should be in rad/sec   If the covariance of the measurement is known, it should be filled in (if all you know is the  variance of each measurement, e.g. from the datasheet, just put those along the diagonal)  A covariance matrix of all zeros will be interpreted as \"covariance unknown\", and to use the  data a covariance will have to be assumed or gotten from some other source   If you have no estimate for one of the data elements (e.g. your IMU doesn't produce an orientation  estimate), please set element 0 of the associated covariance matrix to -1  If you are interpreting this message, please check for a value of -1 in the first element of each  covariance matrix, and disregard the associated estimate.
