notesHeader:
  - This data model is based on the ROS2 nav_msgs/Odometry message type
  - Reference documentation can be found at http://docs.ros.org/en/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html

notesSpecification:
  - The pose property contains the position and orientation estimate with a 6x6 covariance matrix
  - The twist property contains the linear and angular velocity estimates with a 6x6 covariance matrix
  - The header.frameId indicates the reference frame for the pose
  - The childFrameId indicates the reference frame for the twist (typically the robot base frame)
  - Covariance matrices are stored in row-major order with 36 elements
