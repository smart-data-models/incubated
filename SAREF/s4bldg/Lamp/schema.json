The color temperature of any source of radiation is defined as the temperature (in Kelvin) of a black-body or Planckian radiator whose radiation has the same chromaticity as the source of radiation. Often the values are only approximate color temperatures as the black-body radiator cannot emit radiation of every chromaticity value. The color temperatures of the commonest artificial light sources range from less than 3000K (warm white) to 4000K (intermediate) and over 5000K (daylight). Usually measured in degrees Kelvin (K)."

Luminous flux is measured either for the interior as a whole or for a part of the interior (partial luminous flux for a solid angle). All other photometric parameters are derivatives of luminous flux. Luminous flux is measured in lumens (lm). The luminous flux is given as a nominal value for each lamp. Usually measured in Lumen (lm, Candela Steradian)."

Ballasts are needed to operate Discharge Lamps such as Fluorescent, Compact Fluorescent, High-pressure Mercury, Metal Halide and High-pressure Sodium Lamps. Magnetic ballasts are chokes which limit the current passing through a lamp connected in series on the principle of self-induction. The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional (EC-A series) and VVG Low-loss ballasts (EC-B series). Low-loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load. Electronic ballasts are used to run fluorescent lamps at high frequencies (approx. 35 - 40 kHz)."
