GLAND: Valve with a tapered seating, in which a rotatable plug is retained by means of a gland and gland packing. GLOBE: Screwdown valve that has a spherical body. LUBRICATEDPLUG: Plug valve in which a lubricant is injected under pressure between the plug face and the body. NEEDLE: Valve for regulating the flow in or from a pipe, in which a slender cone moves along the axis of flow to close against a fixed conical seat. PARALLELSLIDE: Screwdown valve that has a machined plate that slides in formed grooves to form a seal. PLUG: Valve that has a ported plug that can be turned relative to the body seat ports.

The float may be a ball attached to a lever or other mechanism HYDRAULIC: A valve that is opened and closed by hydraulic actuation LEVER: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a lever rotating the gate within the valve. LOCKSHIELD: A valve that requires the use of a special lockshield key for opening and closing, the operating mechanism being protected by a shroud during normal operation. MOTORIZED: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of an electric motor on an actuator PNEUMATIC: A valve that is opened and closed by pneumatic actuation SOLENOID: A valve that is normally held open by a magnetic field in a coil acting on the gate but that is closed immediately if the electrical current generating the magnetic field is removed. SPRING: A valve that is normally held in position by the pressure of a spring on a plate but that may be caused to open if the pressure of the fluid is sufficient to overcome the spring pressure. THERMOSTATIC: A valve in which the ports are opened or closed to maintain a required predetermined temperature. WHEEL: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a wheel moving the gate within the valve."

ANGLED_2_PORT: Valve in which the direction of flow is changed through 90 degrees. STRAIGHT_2_PORT: Valve in which the flow is straight through. STRAIGHT_3_PORT: Valve with three separate ports.
