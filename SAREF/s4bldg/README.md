List of Types under s4bldg
### Types

[Actuator](https://github.com/smart-data-models/incubated/tree/master/SAREF/s4bldg//Actuator/README.md) - An actuator is a mechanical device for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. An actuator takes energy, usually created by air, electricity, or liquid, and converts that into some kind of motion.

[AirToAirHeatRecovery](https://github.com/smart-data-models/incubated/tree/master/SAREF/s4bldg//AirToAirHeatRecovery/README.md) - An air-to-air heat recovery device employs a counter-flow heat exchanger between inbound and outbound air flow. It is typically used to transfer heat from warmer air in one chamber to cooler air in the second chamber (i.e., typically used to recover heat from the conditioned air being exhausted and the outside air being supplied to a building), resulting in energy savings from reduced heating (or cooling) requirements.

[Alarm](https://github.com/smart-data-models/incubated/tree/master/SAREF/s4bldg//Alarm/README.md) - An alarm is a device that signals the existence of a condition or situation that is outside the boundaries of normal expectation or that activates such a device.  Alarms include the provision of break glass buttons and manual pull boxes that are used to activate alarms.

[AudioVisualAppliance](https://github.com/smart-data-models/incubated/tree/master/SAREF/s4bldg//AudioVisualAppliance/README.md) - An audio-visual appliance is a device that displays, captures, transmits, or receives audio or video.  Audio-visual appliances may be fixed in place or may be able to be moved from one space to another. They may require an electrical supply that may be supplied either by an electrical circuit or provided from a local battery source. Audio-visual appliances may be connected to data circuits including specialist circuits for audio visual purposes only.

[Boiler](https://github.com/smart-data-models/incubated/tree/master/SAREF/s4bldg//Boiler/README.md) - A boiler is a closed, pressure-rated vessel in which water or other fluid is heated using an energy source such as natural gas, heating oil, or electricity. The fluid in the vessel is then circulated out of the boiler for use in various processes or heating applications.

[Building](https://github.com/smart-data-models/incubated/tree/master/SAREF/s4bldg//Building/README.md) - A building represents a structure that provides shelter for its occupants or contents and stands in one place. The building is also used to provide a basic element within the spatial structure hierarchy for the components of a building project (together with site, storey, and space).

[BuildingSpace](https://github.com/smart-data-models/incubated/tree/master/SAREF/s4bldg//BuildingSpace/README.md) - An entity used to define the physical spaces of the building. A building space contains devices or building objects.

[Burner](https://github.com/smart-data-models/incubated/tree/master/SAREF/s4bldg//Burner/README.md) - A burner is a device that converts fuel into heat through combustion. It includes gas, oil, and wood burners.

The chilled fluid is then used to cool and dehumidify air in a building.

[Coil](https://github.com/smart-data-models/incubated/tree/master/SAREF/s4bldg//Coil/README.md) - A coil is a device used to provide heat transfer between non-mixing media. A common example is a cooling coil, which utilizes a finned coil in which circulates chilled water, antifreeze, or refrigerant that is used to remove heat from air moving across the surface of the coil. A coil may be used either for heating or cooling purposes by placing a series of tubes (the coil) carrying a heating or cooling fluid into an airstream. The coil may be constructed from tubes bundled in a serpentine form or from finned tubes that give a extended heat transfer surface.  Coils may also be used for non-airflow cases such as embedded in a floor slab.

Typically mounted overhead near or within a ceiling, the cooled beam uses convection to cool the space below it by acting as a heat sink for the naturally rising warm air of the space. Once cooled, the air naturally drops back to the floor where the cycle begins again.

[CoolingTower](https://github.com/smart-data-models/incubated/tree/master/SAREF/s4bldg//CoolingTower/README.md) - A cooling tower is a device which rejects heat to ambient air by circulating a fluid such as water through it to reduce its temperature by partial evaporation.
