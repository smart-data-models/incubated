  "description": "A flow instrument reads and displays the value of a particular property of a system at a point, or displays the difference in the value of a property between two points.  Instrumentation is typically for the purpose of determining the value of the property at a point in time. It is not the purpose of an instrument to record or integrate the values over time (although they may be connected to recording devices that do perform such a function). This entity provides for all forms of mechanical flow instrument (thermometers, pressure gauges etc.) and electrical flow instruments (ammeters, voltmeters etc.)",
