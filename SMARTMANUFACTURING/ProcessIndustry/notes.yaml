notesPrevious:
  These are generic data models for process industry. The models have been developed from the needs of steelmaking, but similar data structures are expected appropriate in other application areas as well. The processes can be batch processes or continuous.

notesEnd:
  These data models were developed in the project ALCHIMIA - Data and decentralized Artificial intelligence for a competitive and green European metallurgy industry. This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101070046. See https://alchimia-project.eu/
