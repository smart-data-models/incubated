Missing values may be indicated simply by the value being empty in other cases a special value may have been used e.g. '-', 'NaN', '0', '-9999' etc.The 'missingValues' property provides a way to indicate that these values should be interpreted as equivalent to null. The 'missingValues' are strings rather than being the data type of the particular field. This allows for comparison prior to casting and for fields to have missing value which are not of their type, for example a 'number' field to have missing values indicated by '-'.The default value of 'missingValue' for a non-string type field is the empty string ''. For string type fields there is no default for 'missingValue' (for string fields the empty string '' is a valid value and need not indicate null). Values that when encountered in the source, should be considered as 'null', 'not present', or 'blank' values"
