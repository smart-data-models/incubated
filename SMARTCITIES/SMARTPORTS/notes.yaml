  This folder contains data models for the management of cargo/units transportation through the road, railway and maritime transportation means that operate at the port terminal infrastructure.  This model has adopted multiple ideas from the following initiatives: BiTAS (Blockchain in Transport Alliance, https://bitastandardscouncil.org/), Multimodal Transport Data Model (UN/CEFACT, https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/publication/Transport%20and%20Logistics/MMT%20RDM/HTML/001.htm), DCSA Interface for track & trace (DCSA, https://dcsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DCSA-Interface-Standard-for-Track-and-Trace-1.2.pdf), and Project on Container Port Management 4.0 developed by Fundación Valenciaport.
  
  A specific standard has not been adapted for the attributes values, since it will depend on the environment where the data model is applied. For example, in the Location concept there is an attribute called location:
     /** Location code */
     public location?: string;
  The data model is agnostic with respect to whether we want to use UN/LOCODE codes, postal codes, ISO country codes or any other code that is used to encode places.
